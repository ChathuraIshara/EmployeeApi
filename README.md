# EmployeeApi
Minimal API in .NET refers to a lightweight way of building HTTP APIs with minimal boilerplate code introduced in ASP.NET Core 6.
Why was Minimal API introduced?
* Before .NET 6, you had to use Controllers, Attributes, and a lot of startup configuration for Web APIs.
* For small services or microservices, that was too much code.

Minimal API lets you create an API endpoint with just a few lines.

Key Features of Minimal API

* No need for Controllers or Action methods.
* Uses top-level statements in Program.cs.
* Perfect for small APIs, microservices, prototypes.
* Built on top of the same ASP.NET Core pipeline as MVC, so itâ€™s not a separate framework.
we can define Minimal api endpoint in program.cs file using app.MapGet() like wise
